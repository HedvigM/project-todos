# Project Todos

In this weeks project we started to make our own reducers and actions in the redux store.

## The problem

I approaced the weeks project by making one funktion at the time. I started with the input field and expanded the functionalities from there. I had a hard time with the syntax of the store and how to write the functionalities to use the store. I solved it throw a lot of googling and looking at different examples.

If i had more time i would make a sorting function on the app, so there would be possible to sort by date/ time and the different categories. And also a possibility to remove all the todos with a button. Also a would make a local storage.
